# Part 1
The first step of attacking the weakness in the XMAS data is to find the first
number in the list (after the preamble) which is not the sum of two of the 25
numbers before it. **What is the first number that does not have this
property?**

```{r}
window <- 25
i <- window + 1

valid <- function(i) {
  number <- input[[i]]
  preamble <- input[(i-window):i-1]
  number - preamble
  any(preamble %in% (number - preamble))
}

i<-window + 1
while(valid(i)) {
  i <- i+1
}
input[[i]]
```
