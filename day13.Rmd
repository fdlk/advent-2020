```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
input <- readLines("day13.txt")
input
```
# Part 1

```{r}
timestamp <- as.integer(input[[1]])
buses <- tibble(id = input[[2]]) %>%
  separate_rows(id) %>%
  filter(id != "x") %>%
  type_convert(cols(id = col_double()))
buses
```
What is the ID of the earliest bus you can take to the airport multiplied by the 
number of minutes you'll need to wait for that bus?

```{r}
first <-
  buses %>%
  mutate(wait = id - timestamp %% id) %>%
  filter(wait == min(wait))
first$id[[1]] * first$wait[[1]]
```
